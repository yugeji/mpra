ATAC-STARR seq data

In /home/unix/xinchen/ATAC_STARRdata
ATACSTARR_GM12878Lib_*_merged.txt - Raw read counts for all fragments. First five columns are plasmid DNA controls, last five columns are the number of RNA reads.
ATACSTARR_GM12878Lib_*_merged_0.1RPM_counts.txt - Raw read counts for fragments with >0.1 reads per million in DNA and RNA samples
ATACSTARR_GM12878Lib_*_merged_RPM_0.1RPM.txt_output.txt - Processed data with, among other things, ratios of DNA to RNA.

In /broad/compbio/liang/for_Xinchen
sharpr2-manual.pdf* contains format and descriptions of the following file:

/ForLiangATACSTARR_GM12878Lib_150_600_merged_0.2RPM_RNAtoDNA_FC_result/ForLiangATACSTARR_GM12878Lib_150_600_merged_0.2RPM_RNAtoDNA_FC_result_alpha005_exact_rev.RData
contains the SHARPR scores for the ATACSTARR sequences, run on the final processed version (ATACSTARR output.txt)

Data structure of R file:
whole_re[[i]], i=chr - returned object
	       relevant returned values:
	       	       n_reg: number of regulatory regions (~50k)
	       	       region: (_, _, _, ) - coordinates of the region
		       score: the actual relevant SHARPR score for the tile region
		       	      est_a(locus regulatory scores), sd_e, lambda (ridge coeff)
